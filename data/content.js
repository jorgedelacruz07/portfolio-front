    "I’m a Software Engineer with professional experience since April 2016. I began my career working with Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and MySQL, and gradually transitioned to using React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. On the backend, I specialize in Node.js with frameworks like Express.js and have built scalable APIs and web applications. I’m continuously exploring AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality. Currently, I'm involved in key projects aimed at improving user engagement, metrics, and overall UX. I’m comfortable working in collaborative environments using tools like Notion, Jira, Slack, GitHub, Postman, and Visual Studio Code.",
